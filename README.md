## Overview

Welcome to our Embedded Systems Lab projects repository! This collection includes several labs that explore key concepts in embedded systems. Each project uses microcontrollers, sensors, and communication protocols to create real-world embedded systems applications. The labs were done as part of our coursework and are documented for future reference and learning.
